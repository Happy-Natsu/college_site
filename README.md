# college_site
These are all the changes I made in the college site. I made major changes in http://www.jntuacea.ac.in/75years/index.html.
1) I made the social media icons more responsive and stylish. If we move the cursor on the icons they highlights with little animation.
   I uploaded the index.html file in which I made changes above.
   The file location in collge site source is.
   www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
   I replaced the existing code for social icons to this
   {
      <div>
            <div class="col">
            <footer id="footerpad">
                <div class="wrapper">
                    <div class="button">
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Jntua-Anantapur/100071950200345/">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
                    </div>
                    <span>Facebook</span>
                    </a>
                    </div>
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/jntuau">
                    <div class="button">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
                    </div>
                    <span>Twitter</span>
                    </a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="button">
                    <a href="https://instagram.com/jntuacea_75?utm_medium=copy_link">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
                    </div>
                    <span>Instagram</span>
                    </a>
                    </div>
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/jntua-college-of-engineering-anantapur/posts/?feedView=all">
                    <div class="button">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>
                    </div>
                    <span>Linkedin</span>
                    </a>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="copyright text-muted text-center">Copyright &copy; JNTUACEA | All rights reserved.</p>
            </footer>
        </div>
  }
  and made changes in the Footer-with-social-media-icons.css file which I uploaded above. The location of Footer-with-social-media-icons.css in college site is
  www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\assets\css\Footer-with-social-media-icons.css.
  ->replce the existing code for socila media icons in all html pages in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years to see change in all pages.
2) In www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html I felt thet the images of events,gallery and support are not atractive so I added three images in
   www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\assets\img file and replaced the source of 1,2 and 3 images with 3,4 and 5 in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
3) I thought it is better to put college logo above nav bar than text("JNTUACEA"), so I put college logo above navbar in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
I hope I explained clearly what the changes and where the changes I made without any complication.Please let me know I there is any thing that you dont understand.
