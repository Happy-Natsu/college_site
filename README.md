# college_site
These are all the changes I made in the college site. I made major changes in http://www.jntuacea.ac.in/75years/index.html.
1) I made the social media icons more responsive and stylish. If we move the cursor on the icons they highlights with little animation.
   I uploaded the index.html file in which I made changes above.
   The file location in collge site source is.
   www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
   I replaced the existing code for social icons and made changes in the Footer-with-social-media-icons.css file which I uploaded above.
   The location of Footer-with-social-media-icons.css in college site is
   www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\assets\css\Footer-with-social-media-icons.css.
  ->replce the existing code for socila media icons in all html pages in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years to see change in all pages.
2) In www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html I felt thet the images of events,gallery and support are not atractive so I added three images in
   www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\assets\img file and replaced the source of 1,2 and 3 images with 3,4 and 5 in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
3) I thought it is better to put college logo above nav bar than text("JNTUACEA"), so I put college logo above navbar in www.jntuacea.ac.in\75years\index.html.
I hope I explained clearly what the changes and where the changes I made without any complication.Please let me know I there is any thing that you dont understand.
